v 0.9: Initial Version Created for the Sample Corpus (May 5, 2009)

v 1.0 Changed the type of the entity_id attribute for the link
element from IDREF to CDTA.  This is to allows the values of the
entity_id attribute to be definied outside the file. Added the 
class attribute on the facts element, to indicate the type of 
infobox the facts were parsed from. (June 10, 2009)
