<wiki_text><![CDATA[Tseung Kwan O New Town

Tseung Kwan O New Town (traditional Chinese: 將軍澳新市鎮) is one of the nine new
towns in Hong Kong, mainly built on reclaimed land in the northern half of the
Tseung Kwan O, after which it is named.

 Geography

Although lying within Sai Kung District in the southeastern New Territories, the
new town is often incorrectly regarded as part of Kowloon due to its close
proximity to the city. The total development area of Tseung Kwan O, including
its industrial estate, is about 10.05 km².

 History and urban development

The Hong Kong Government had been interested in developing a new town at Hang
Hau because of its proximity to the urban area. The project was postponed for a
long time owing to the extensive scale of reclamation in the bay, which is
rather deep. It finally started under the name of Tseung Kwan O.

The New Town was developed in three phases. The first phase encompassing
Northern Tseung Kwan O, which includes Po Lam MTR Station and Hang Hau Station,
while the second and third phase encompassing Southern Tseung Kwan O, which
includes Tseung Kwan O Station (Town Centre) and Tiu Keng Leng Station.

The planning of the new town has been centred along the MTR-corridor, with more
than 80% of the population living within 5 minutes of an MTR station, with huge
residential complexes surrounding the MTR stations. As most of the residential
complexes surrounds the MTR station, there are huge parks in the rest of Tseung
Kwan O New Town.

 Population

According to , the population of Tseung Kwan O New Town is around 290,095.

As Tseung Kwan O is not considered a formal entity in the census, the above
population figure takes into account residents of the following breakdown
figures in Sai Kung District which comprise Tseung Kwan O New Town: Hang Hau,
Sheung Tak, Tsui Lam, Hong King, Po Lam, Yan Ying, Wan Hang, King Lam, Hau Tak,
Fu Yu, Tung Ming, On Hong, and Kwon Ming.

The other three census areas in Sai Kung District - namely Sai Kung Central, Pak
Sha Wan, and Sai Kung Islands - are not within the new town.

 Facilities

Tseung Kwan O Hospital is located on Po Ning Lane in the Hang Hau area. A public
sports centre and a library are situated by the roundabout at the end of Tseung
Kwan O Tunnel Road. Tseung Kwan O lacks a performing arts centre.

 Sports

Tseung Kwan O Sports Ground is being built for the 2009 East Asian Games. It
will be completed in early 2009 and will also host Hong Kong First Division
League matches.

 Shopping

Tseung Kwan O has several major shopping complexes:

The largest shopping centre is Metro City (Chinese: 新都城) located by Po Lam MTR
Station. Metro City is divided into three phases and contains most of Hong
Kong's major chains such as Park'n Shop (supermarket) and Fortress (electronics)
in addition to a selection of restaurants ranging from Maxim's Chinese
Restaurant to McDonald's and everything in between.

Hang Hau MTR Station is surrounded by an extensive network of mid-sized shopping
arcades linked by footbridges. The mainstay of this multifarious complex is the
Jusco department store at East Point City (Chinese: 東港城).

Tseung Kwan O Town Centre (Tseung Kwan O MTR Station) is home to Park Central
(Chinese: 將軍澳中心) and Tseung Kwan O Plaza (Chinese: 將軍澳廣場). Both complexes are
very new and relatively underdeveloped with little more than a handful of
restaurants and small shops.

 Industrial estate

Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate is located in the southeast of the town. It is
the site of an MTR depot and TVB City, the headquarters of Hong Kong's largest
television broadcaster. The future mass housing development Dream City will be
built just north of the industrial estate.

Bus routes 797M (NWFB) and 298E (KMB) connect the industrial estate to southern
Tseung Kwan O. A spur line of the MTR's Tseung Kwan O Line is already under
construction and, when completed, will provide easy access to the industrial
estate from Kowloon and Hong Kong Island.

 Transport

 Rail

Tseung Kwan O is served by the MTR metro systems's Tseung Kwan O Line, which
currently has four stations in the new town:

All stations are either connected to or in the proximity of shopping centres and
large private housing developments.

 Bus

The new town is also connected by a well-covered public bus and minibus network.
Hong Kong's three major bus operators all have routes with termini in Tseung
Kwan O:
